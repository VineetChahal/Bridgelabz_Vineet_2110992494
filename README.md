## Overview
This branch focuses on concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) and the practical implementation of different iterators in JavaScript. It emphasizes the foundational principles of OOP and how iterators streamline data traversal in JavaScript.

## Topics Covered

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
- **Core Principles:**
  - Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods operating on that data within objects.
  - Inheritance: Deriving new classes from existing ones, promoting code reuse.
  - Polymorphism: Enabling a single interface to represent different underlying forms (e.g., method overriding).
  - Abstraction: Hiding implementation details while exposing only the functionality.

- **Benefits:**
  - Code reusability and modularity.
  - Improved readability and maintainability.
  - Facilitates design patterns and complex software development.

### Iterators in JavaScript
- **Definition:**
  - Iterators are objects that allow sequential traversal of collections like arrays, strings, or custom data structures.

- **Types of Iterators:**
  - `for`
  - `for...of`
  - `for...in`
  - `forEach`
  - `while`
  - `do...while`

- **Use Cases:**
  - Streamlining data traversal.
  - Implementing lazy evaluations.
  - Simplifying iteration logic in asynchronous operations.
