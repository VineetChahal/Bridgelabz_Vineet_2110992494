#### Overview
This branch focuses on practicing JavaScript concepts and understanding various sorting algorithms, including **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Merge Sort**. The practice involved implementing these algorithms and solving related problems to strengthen problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

#### Topics Covered

**JavaScript Practice Questions**
Practiced questions provided by the trainer from the BridgeLabz.

**Sorting Algorithms**
Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specific order. The following algorithms were studied:

**Bubble Sort**
- **Description**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases; O(n) in the best case (already sorted).

**Selection Sort**
- **Description**: Selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in all cases.

**Insertion Sort**
- **Description**: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases; O(n) in the best case (already sorted).

**Merge Sort**
- **Description**: Divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the sorted halves.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) in all cases.

**Key Learnings**
1. Sorting algorithms have varying efficiency based on input size and data structure.
2. Bubble, Selection, and Insertion sorts are simple but inefficient for large datasets.
3. Merge Sort is more efficient due to its divide-and-conquer approach but requires additional memory for merging.
