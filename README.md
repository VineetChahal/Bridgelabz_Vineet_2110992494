#### Overview  
This branch focuses on fundamental programming concepts, emphasizing **Recursion** and the role of the **Stack** in managing function calls. It provides a comprehensive understanding of these topics to build foundational problem-solving skills and a deeper understanding of program execution.  

#### Topics Covered  

**Recursion**  
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller sub-problems.  

- **Structure**: A recursive function includes a base case (to terminate recursion) and a recursive case (the function calls itself).  
- **Key Characteristics**:  
  - Simplifies problems that have repetitive, self-similar structures (e.g., tree traversal, factorial computation).  
  - Requires careful design to avoid infinite recursion (by ensuring the base case is reached).  
- **Examples**:  
  - Factorial: \( n! = n \times (n-1)! \)  
  - Fibonacci: \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \)  
  - Tower of Hanoi  

**Stack**  
The stack is a data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle, used extensively in recursion and program execution.  

- **Function Call Stack**:  
  - Each function call pushes an entry (activation record) onto the stack.  
  - When a function returns, its entry is popped off the stack.  
  - Tracks local variables, return addresses, and function states.  
- **Recursion and the Stack**:  
  - Each recursive call adds a new frame to the stack.  
  - Too many recursive calls can lead to a **Stack Overflow**.  
  - Memory usage can be optimized using **Tail Recursion** (when supported by the language).  

**Key Insights**  
- Understanding recursion requires recognizing how the stack manages function calls and returns.  
- Debugging recursive programs often involves visualizing the stack to track function calls and base case conditions.  
- Iterative solutions may be more efficient in some cases but lack the simplicity of recursive implementations.
